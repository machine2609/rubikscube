# rubikscube
•Modelled a virtual Rubik's Cube(3X3) in three different models using standard data-structures present in C++
•Achieved a solving time of under 3 seconds for a Rubik's cube jumbled eight times, using BFS, DFS, and IDDFS algorithms. 
•Implemented Korf's IDA* Algorithm achieving a solving time of under 10 seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 13 times using Corner Pattern Database as a heuristic
